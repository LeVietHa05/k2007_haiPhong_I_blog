            <p>
                Apart from providing a luxurious private dining service mentioned previously, we set our eyes
                on a much more noble cause - to make every meal zero waste. <br><br>
                Each year, a staggering 2.5 billion tons of food are wasted globally. If we could salvage even
                10-20% of this, our world would become significantly more sustainable. This challenge has
                become our driving force. <br><br>
                With that in mind, here at NORO, we are committed to making every dish zero or close to
                minimal waste - utilizing every last bit of food scraps. <br><br>
                All of our generated revenue will be directed into charitable and research purposes. We aim
                to help provide more research opportunities for students and youth scientists.ts. <br><br>
                Alongside NORO’s private dining reservations, there will be weekly informative posts of ways
                one can use up food scraps which surprisingly are full of awesomeness.

                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <p>
                    It began with a simple mutual love for food and science.
                    Whether it was a class project or a lab session, we all
                    shared with one another our passion. <br><br>
                    Years later, as we approached our senior year of high
                    school, we decided to elevate our home cooking to new
                    heights. Reuniting around the same flame that first brought
                    us together, it felt as though no time had passed. <br><br>
                    This endeavor showcases our current prowess in culinary
                    arts. Drawing from our diverse backgrounds—including
                    professional kitchen experience and advanced scientific
                    knowledge—we aim to infuse the world of cuisine with
                    fresh, innovative ideas.
